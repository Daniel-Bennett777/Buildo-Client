Project README for BuilDO
Overview
BuilDO is a comprehensive solution addressing the challenge of efficiently connecting customers seeking construction services with professional contractors for remodels and home builds. This platform streamlines the entire process by providing customers with the ability to post detailed work orders. Contractors, in turn, can easily pick up and complete these orders, creating a seamless bridge between those in need of services and the skilled professionals ready to fulfill those needs.

Features and Functionality
The MVP of BuilDO includes essential features for both customers and contractors. Customers can effortlessly post work orders, view their own orders, and leave reviews for contractors. On the other hand, contractors have access to a dashboard displaying available work orders, the ability to pick up and complete orders, and a system for receiving feedback from satisfied customers. The platform is designed to enhance communication and transparency within the construction service ecosystem.

Technologies Used
BuilDO is powered by a robust backend implemented in Python using the Django ORM framework. This ensures efficient data management and seamless interactions between users. The frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. Tailwind CSS is employed for styling, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the platform. The use of these technologies reflects a commitment to a modern and scalable development stack, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Stretch Goals
In addition to the core features, BuilDO aims to implement a User Messaging System as a stretch goal. This feature will enable users to communicate freely with contractors or customers, fostering better collaboration. Users will also receive notifications for new messages, ensuring they stay informed and engaged throughout the service process.

BuilDO represents a sophisticated solution to the challenges of connecting customers and contractors, offering a user-friendly experience backed by cutting-edge technologies.
